    "makes it easy to learn and use, especially for beginners in web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible and Extensible: Flask allows developers to customize and extend the framework \n",
    "according to their specific requirements. It follows a \"micro\" framework approach,\n",
    "providing only the essential features, but allows for the integration of additional \n",
    "libraries and extensions as needed. This flexibility enables developers to tailor their\n",
    "applications precisely to their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: Flask promotes modularity and code reusability.\n",
    "It allows developers to break down their applications into smaller, reusable components\n",
    "called \"blueprints.\" Blueprints enable the organization and separation of application \n",
    "functionalities, making the codebase more manageable and maintainable. \"\"\""
